The UNICORE Workflow engine provides advanced workflow processing
capabilities using UNICORE Resources. The Workflow engine provides
high-level control constructs (for-each, while, if-then-else, etc) and
handles submission and execution of single UNICORE jobs.

The Workflow engine offers a REST API for workflow submission and
management and an easy-to-understand workflow description syntax in
JSON format.

Thanks to a flexible internal workflow execution model, the Workflow
engine can be in principle extended with custom workflow parsers.
