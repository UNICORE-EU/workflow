The UNICORE Workflow System provides advanced
workflow processing capabilities using UNICORE Grid resources.
Its main components are the Workflow Engine and the 
Service Orchestrator. While the Workflow Engine provides high-level
control constructs (for-each, while, if-then-else, etc), the
Service Orchestrator contains a powerful, extensible resource
broker, and deals with execution of single UNICORE jobs.
